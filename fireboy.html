<ul>

Adedamola Adefolahan was born into a Christian home and was raised in the same faith. Beyond the good morals that his parents confidence instilled in him, it also created a love for music in him.

He always considered singing something he could do but not as a serious talent and not something he could even make money from. While he always wrote poems and some song lyrics, it was at the university where he embraced his talent.
